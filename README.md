## Data:
I used Restaurant reviews data for training my Language Model. It had 1000 reviews.

## Model:

Used LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) for building my NN architecture. I used it because it is sequence to sequence model i.e Making it appopriate for this problem.

## Training:

The Model was trained on CPU and 300 reviews only. Due to high computation power I didn't trained it on a TPU.

## Evaluation:

Reviews Generated by this model are good but they can be improved Given Large Data and Deep NN Architecture. Reviews are short and some words looks like missing, its because I only allowed it to show 10 words. We can change it values ourselves.
